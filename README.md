The Precision Stock Market Forecasting in Banking project demonstrates the power of advanced machine learning techniques in predicting stock market trends with high accuracy. This project specifically focuses on banking sector stocks and employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to analyze and predict stock prices.
Utilizing historical market data sourced from Upstox, the project trains robust models to deliver predictions with an outstanding accuracy of 98% for each bank.
